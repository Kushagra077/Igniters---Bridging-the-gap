Project Name
Sign language to  speech with multiple languages


The problem it solves
With help of our application, deaf-dumb people can easily communicate with common people. Our app converts sign language to speak 18 different languages which include 8 Indian languages.



WHAT CAN PEOPLE USE IT FOR, OR HOW IT MAKES EXISTING TASKS EASIER/SAFER

Our application provides an easy medium to connect deaf-dumb people and common people. It converts sign language to text and speech and also provides features of multiple languages for output. For example, I am someone who only understands the Tamil language. With help of this application, I can understand sign language because application will convert sign language into Tamil text and speech output.

Challenges we ran into
We faced one hurdle in how to detect sign language accurately. We used "resnet50" a pre-trained model to solve that hurdle. We train our machine-learning model with large dataset to achieve high accuracy.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION ON HOW YOUR PROJECT FITS INTO TRACK WINNERS TRACK
We made an android application that includes features of machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. With help of our application person can easily understands sign language by text and speech output in different languages.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION ON HOW YOUR PROJECT FITS INTO BEST SUSTAINABILITY HACK SPONSORED BY AVANADE TRACK
With our application, deaf-dumb people can easily communicate with normal people as it converts sign language into text and speech translation with multiple languages support. A deaf-dumb person can communicate with a normal person anywhere in the world as our application includes major languages of the world as well as Indian languages.
